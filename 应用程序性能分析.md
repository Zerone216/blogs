# 使用`gprof`进行性能分析

## 简介

`gprof`产生程序运行时候的函数调用关系，包括调用次数，函数运行时间，调用关系等，可以帮助程序员分析程序的运行流程以及性能瓶颈，以达到编写更高效程序的目的。

## 使用方法

`gprof`的使用方法很简单，大致分为以下几个步骤。

1. 使用`-pg`参数编译可执行程序。
2. 运行可执行程序。
3. 使用`gprof`生成分析结果。

### 例子

我们编写一个程序来演示一下如何使用`gprof`。

程序的源码如下（程序没有特殊含义，只是为了演示`gprof`的使用）：

```cpp
// filename : main.cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>

using namespace std;

void xor_calc()
{
    int t = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < INT32_MAX; ++i)
    {
        t ^= i;
    }
}

void time_cost()
{
    for (int i = 0; i < 3; ++i)
    {
        xor_calc();
    }
}

int main()
{
    time_cost();
    return 0;
}
```

使用`-pg`参数编译程序：

```shell
g++ main.cpp -o main -pg
```

得到可执行程序`main`。

运行`main`程序。

```shell
./main
```

程序运行结束后会产生一个`gmon.out`文件。

使用`gprof`生成分析结果。

```shell
gprof main
```

**注意：这里使用的是`main`，而不是`gmon.out`。**

此时终端输出分析结果。（也可以使用`gprof main > filename`将输出重定向到文件便于分析）。

输出结果可以分为两个部分，第一个部分如下：

 %         the percentage of the total running time of the
time       program used by this function.

cumulative a running sum of the number of seconds accounted
 seconds   for by this function and those listed above it.

 self      the number of seconds accounted for by this
seconds    function alone.  This is the major sort for this
           listing.

calls      the number of times this function was invoked, if
           this function is profiled, else blank.

 self      the average number of milliseconds spent in this
ms/call    function per call, if this function is profiled,
	   else blank.

 total     the average number of milliseconds spent in this
ms/call    function and its descendents per call, if this
	   function is profiled, else blank.

name       the name of the function.  This is the minor sort
           for this listing. The index shows the location of
	   the function in the gprof listing. If the index is
	   in parenthesis it shows where it would appear in
	   the gprof listing if it were to be printed.

上一部分给出了分析结果，下面的部分是对分析结果的解释。

可以看出，分析结果给出了：

* 函数运行时间百分比
* 函数运行的总时间（不包括子函数）
* 函数运行总时间（包括子函数）
* 调用次数 
* 函数平均调用时间（不包括子函数）
* 函数平均调用时间（包括子函数）
* 函数名称

整个列表默认按照函数运行总时间（包括子函数）排序。

接下来看第二个部分：调用图。

 This table describes the call tree of the program, and was sorted by
 the total amount of time spent in each function and its children.

 Each entry in this table consists of several lines.  The line with the
 index number at the left hand margin lists the current function.
 The lines above it list the functions that called this function,
 and the lines below it list the functions this one called.
 This line lists:
     index	A unique number given to each element of the table.
		Index numbers are sorted numerically.
		The index number is printed next to every function name so
		it is easier to look up where the function is in the table.

     % time	This is the percentage of the `total' time that was spent
		in this function and its children.  Note that due to
		different viewpoints, functions excluded by options, etc,
		these numbers will NOT add up to 100%.

     self	This is the total amount of time spent in this function.

     children	This is the total amount of time propagated into this
		function by its children.

     called	This is the number of times the function was called.
		If the function called itself recursively, the number
		only includes non-recursive calls, and is followed by
		a `+' and the number of recursive calls.

     name	The name of the current function.  The index number is
		printed after it.  If the function is a member of a
		cycle, the cycle number is printed between the
		function's name and the index number.


 For the function's parents, the fields have the following meanings:

     self	This is the amount of time that was propagated directly
		from the function into this parent.

     children	This is the amount of time that was propagated from
		the function's children into this parent.

     called	This is the number of times this parent called the
		function `/' the total number of times the function
		was called.  Recursive calls to the function are not
		included in the number after the `/'.

     name	This is the name of the parent.  The parent's index
		number is printed after it.  If the parent is a
		member of a cycle, the cycle number is printed between
		the name and the index number.

 If the parents of the function cannot be determined, the word
 `<spontaneous>' is printed in the `name' field, and all the other
 fields are blank.

 For the function's children, the fields have the following meanings:

     self	This is the amount of time that was propagated directly
		from the child into the function.

     children	This is the amount of time that was propagated from the
		child's children to the function.

     called	This is the number of times the function called
		this child `/' the total number of times the child
		was called.  Recursive calls by the child are not
		listed in the number after the `/'.

     name	This is the name of the child.  The child's index
		number is printed after it.  If the child is a
		member of a cycle, the cycle number is printed
		between the name and the index number.

 If there are any cycles (circles) in the call graph, there is an
 entry for the cycle-as-a-whole.  This entry shows who called the
 cycle (as parents) and the members of the cycle (as children.)
 The `+' recursive calls entry shows the number of function calls that
 were internal to the cycle, and the calls entry for each member shows,
 for that member, how many times it was called from other members of
 the cycle.
